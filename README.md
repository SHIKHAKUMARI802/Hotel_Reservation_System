üè® Hotel Reservation System<br>
The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based web application that enables users to check the availability of rooms, book rooms, and manage reservations for a hotel.
The project is developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL as the backend database. It aims to provide a seamless and interactive user experience for customers who
want to book rooms in a hotel.

* Project Features:<br>
 -Room Availability Search: Users can input check-in and check-out dates to search for available rooms based on their preferences.<br>
-Room Booking: Once the rooms are displayed, users can select a room type and book it. The system will update the room's status as "booked" in the database.<br>
-User Registration & Login: Users need to sign up or log in to book a room. The login system is integrated to ensure secure access to booking features.<br>
-Database Integration: The system uses MySQL to store and retrieve information about rooms, users, and bookings. Room details include room type, price, and status (available or booked).<br>
-Responsive Frontend: The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly and responsive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and book rooms.<br>

* Work Flow:<br>
-Homepage (hotel.jsp): Users start by entering check-in and check-out dates on the homepage. They can also specify the number of adults and children.<br>
-Room Availability (room.jsp): Based on the user‚Äôs input, the system fetches room availability from the database. Available rooms are displayed in separate
 boxes with details like room type and price.<br>
-Room Booking: Users can click the "Book Now" button for a room, which directs them to the sign-up/login page. After logging in, users fill in their personal
 details to complete the booking process.<br>
-Booking Confirmation: The system updates the room‚Äôs status in the database to "booked" and confirms the booking to the user.<br>
